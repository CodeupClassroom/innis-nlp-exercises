    "Note that usually stemming has a fixed set of rules, hence, the root stems may not be lexicographically correct. This means that the stemmed words may not be semantically correct, and might have a chance of not being present in the dictionary (as we'll see in the output of stemming)."

    "#### Step 6: Removing stopwords\n",
    "\n",
    "Words which have little or no significance, especially when constructing meaningful features from text, are known as stop words (or stopwords). These are usually words that end up having the maximum frequency if you do a simple term or word frequency in a corpus. Typically, these can be articles, conjunctions, prepositions and so on. Some examples of stopwords: a, an, the, and like.\n",
    "\n",
    "While there is no universal stopword list, we will use a standard English language stopwords list from nltk. You can also add your own domain-specific stopwords as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before removing stopwords, we want to segment text into linguistic units such as words or numbers. This process is called tokenization."
